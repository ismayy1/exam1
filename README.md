# Music Playlist App
Music has always been a passion of mine, and with the advent of apps like Spotify, sharing music has never been easier. My friends and I are always creating playlists for any occassion, a birthday party, a BBQ, a road trip, or even just a Saturday night spent inside. I saw this project as an opportunity to have a centralized place to create music playlists from scratch, create it in a music app like Spotify, and then share it with friends.

##Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Firebase
- Axios

###Build Strategy
I started by focusing on CRUD and meeting those requirements. Once I had the ability to name the playlist and edit that name, and then add songs to the playlist and delete those songs, I was able to move on to the icing on the cake. I added the song info functionality where I have a getRequest to a third party API and render all the information, including a link which will launch Spotify on the selected Arist's page.

###Complications/Future Improvements
I would like to add the ability to save playlists and then access all previously created playlists. I also want to add the ability to log in and then add collaborators via email and everyone who is added can add/remove songs to the playlist as they see fit. Once those are added, I feel that I will have an app that I will be using with my friends on a weekly (if not daily) basis.
